Being a parent can be difficult when you have multiple children involved in extracurricular activities. The majority of K-12 school systems are not using the most effective methods for communicating with parents regarding their children’s athletic and/or extracurricular groups. The Sportive & Scholastic Parent Portal application gives parents the opportunity to stay up to date with all of their children’s busy schedules. Schools are able to administer specific groups within the app to serve as a social platform for parents with kids who participate in the same activities. Within these groups, parents have the ability to view their children’s practice and game schedules, event locations, and important information regarding each event. Parents are notified about emergency schedule changes as well. Parents can also share ideas and reach out to other parents within the application. The Sportive & Scholastic Parent Portal application breaks the communication barrier between schools and parents.
